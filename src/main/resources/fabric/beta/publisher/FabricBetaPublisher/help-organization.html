<div>
    Fabric Organization is necessary if you want the plugin to output links for your builds
    (they look like https://fabric.io/{organization}/android/apps/{package}/beta/releases/{id}
    as well as set environment variable FABRIC_BETA_BUILD_URL (FABRIC_BETA_BUILD_URL_n if there are multiple APKs).
    Leave the field empty if you don't need this.
